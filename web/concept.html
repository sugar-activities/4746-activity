            <h2>What is it?</h2>
            <p>A game for the XO-PC. The game uses fueling a rocket to get it into space to teach fractions, specifically arithmetic operations. Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are covered, as well as decimal to fraction conversion and proportions.</p>

            <h2>What Does it Use?</h2>
            <p>The game was created to run on the Sugar Operating System on the XO-PC. It is built in Python with PyGame.</p>

            <h3>Interface:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Player starts at start screen, then they can continue progress or select any unlocked lesson (stage) and the difficulty</li>
                <li>Lesson shows goal containers, choice containers overlain on the rocket art.</li>
                <li>Each choice container has a fraction and the player must choose the correct fraction(s) to match the goal container's.</li>
                <li>Click to select, click again to deselect to transfer liquid to big container</li>
                <li>Must correctly use ratios and other fraction operations to fill container correctly</li>
                <li>A Reset Button allows the player to reset the lesson. A Check Answer button is used. If the answer the right, the rocket is fueled and goes higher. Otherwise, the player has to try again.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Level System:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Different "lessons" are taught for each "journey" or trip from the ground to space</li>
                <li>As the rocket gets higher, the concepts get more advanced/in-depth</li>
                <li>Each lesson has a learning goal, which is met when the final problems are solved and the rocket is in space</li>
                <li>At the end of a lesson, a cool graphic is displayed</li>
            </ul>
