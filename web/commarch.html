            <h2>Description, purpose, and goals</h2>
            <p>The project is a game written with PyGame for the XO. It is an educational game to teach kids how to tell time, specifically on analog clocks, which a lot of children struggle with.</p>

            <p>The project is relatively new but it was developed quite rapidly. It received many awards and was recognized by the White House.</p>
            <p>The team is small. It consists of 4 people, all of whom have made commits. Because of the small size, there hasn't been turnover (at least in the Github history), and everyone contributes. Out of the team members, David seems to fix bugs and make sure the quality assurance is good and Jen seemed to contribute most of the art.</p>
            <p>Because the team is so small, the project seems to fail both the Raptor Test and the Git-by-a-bus Test. If either of those events happen, the project would definitely suffer.</p>
