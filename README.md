Running
-------
To run, make sure you have all of the application's dependencies installed on your machine. 
run `sudo apt-get install python-pygame` using a debian based distro.

To run the game run `python Main.py`


Installing onto the OLPC
------------------------
To install on our application on the OLPC we used [Sugar Activity Quick Start](https://github.com/FOSSRIT/SAQS-sugar-activity-quick-start-). Follow the instructions there to create a .xo file.

Once we created the .xo file we copied it onto a flash drive and plugged it into the OLPC

Open the .xo file on the OLPC to install and launch the game. If you have a previous version of the game installed on your OLPC, delete the .Activity file and relaunch the new .xo file to overwrite it.
